# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - Tells you if the request was a success

2. `Response.status` - Tells you if the request was a success as well

3. `Response.url` - This will show the final URL gained after any redirects

4. `Response.headers` - This is the type of data type that's being used.


# Teacher Feedback

Yes but what is the difference between `response.ok` and `response.status` if they both tell you if the request was a success?
